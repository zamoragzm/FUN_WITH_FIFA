## Description of Project

The objective for this project is to analyze players and their respective attributes and find interesting information and relationships between. Mainly information that FIFA 21 fans might enjoy knowing. Also, finding information that may give fifa players more insight in the game to finally have an advantage in the game or know disadvantages of players. Another interest is knowing how consistent are overalls with their respective stats and positions. I am interested in this dataset because I am a big fan of the FIFA games and will love to learn more about the data of the players and if possible know information that will help me exploit mechanics in-game. I am still debating the questions I am going to ask for the project, however I would really like to know the highest overalls by position. A dashboard will be interesting to show this question specifically.

## Description of Dataset

This FIFA 21 data is provided by a user in kaggle who got the data from fifaindex database. In the data all the players in fifa 21 exixt with their respective stats and information. Ex(Name, age, height, nationality, position, overall, weak foot, shooting, etc..). It contains more than 10,000 rows(players) and more than 50 attributes for each player. The data was collected and updated in the date 09/10/2020. The purpose of this dataset is mainly fun and learning more of how do fifa stats work, and to find relationship between them. The data was scraped with bs4. The data falls under a "CC0: Public Domain". The data is going to be processed even further by removing variables of no interest as photos of the players and removing all players who their overall rating falls below 70. The other things that will be removed are players that are not actively playing in real life and they just classify as icons(historic players) in the fifa game.
